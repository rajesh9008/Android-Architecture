# Android-Architecture

App built with Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture without using any architectural frameworks.

Library used

Retrofit : https://square.github.io/retrofit/
Picasso  : http://square.github.io/picasso/

The use of both activities and fragments allows for a better separation of concerns which complements this implementation of MVP. In this version of the app, the Activity is the overall controller which creates and connects views and presenters.
The use of fragments supports tablet layouts or UI screens with multiple views.
